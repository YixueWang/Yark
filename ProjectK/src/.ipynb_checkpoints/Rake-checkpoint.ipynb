Annan also suggested that the council set deadlines for compliance with its previous resolutions on the issue. And he warned that unless Eritrea's restrictions on UNMEE movements, including a ban on helicopter flights, were lifted rapidly, \"\"I would be obliged to make recommendations to the council concerning force deployment on the ground by the end of January 2006.\"\" Annan's report was released amid a continuing stalemate in the Horn of Africa border dispute after UNMEE last month completed the withdrawal of its North American and European UN peacekeepers from Eritrea, meeting a deadline set by Asmara for their expulsions.\"\n",
